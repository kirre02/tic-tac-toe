## About

This project was built for an assignment at [IT-HÃ¶gskolan](https://www.iths.se/). The goal was to use JavaFX to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the MVC architecture.
The project allows you to play against a computer.

## Technologies & Libraries

- **Java** - Core programming language used.
- **JavaFX** - Library used to create the graphical user interface.

## What I learned

This project allowed me to gain experience in several new areas:
- **MVC Design Pattern** - Applied the Model-View-Controller (MCV) pattern within a graphical application.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kirre02/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
3. Ensure you have Java installed (this project is developed with JDK 22)
   - You can install java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/se/java/technologies/downloads/archive/)
4. Open the project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/):
   - Go to **File > Open** and select the project folder
   - Intellij should detect the project structure and automatically set up the necessary configurations.
5. Run the client:
   - Open `GameApplication.java`, and select the **Run TicTacToe'** option.

## Possible Upgrades

If I were to continue building on this project these are a few enhancements I would implement:

- **Enhanced Styling** - Add player customizability and polished styles to the game
- **Online Option** - Would be possible to add a websocket server so that the player has the possibility to play against other players and not only against the computer.
